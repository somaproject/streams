How to test this? 

1. instrument process, query framework
2. how does the FIR filter work? Can it handle having the right
amount of state? 


What is the right way to test this? What are we rendering
at any given point in time? 

Cycle: 
1. render request
2. process() each element


What are the tests we want? 
Filter test: we can update / generate new outputs if, and only if, we
are aware of it

Add rendering subrendering, etc.
