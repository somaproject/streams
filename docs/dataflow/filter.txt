This is very complex. 

region (t1, t2)

So this  means that we should try and get (t1, t2) into our cache. 

1. what are we missing of this region that should already be in
our cache? 

2. what is the region over which we should calculate.... 

3. We would love to have some sort of generic "stream computation"
over  a finite region with fixed sampling rate.
