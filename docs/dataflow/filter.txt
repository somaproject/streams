This is very complex. 

region (t1, t2)

So this  means that we should try and get (t1, t2) into our cache. 

assume that (t1, t1') and (t2', t2) are in the cache but (t1', t2') 
aren not. 1. How do we determine this? 

Assume we know that our "delay" for this operation is T, so that we would
need inputs for range (t1 - T, t2)

We can query our local cache to see what the values of the inputs
over that range are. 

so, let's consider: 

1. Find the region (t1 -T, t2) that we care about. 
2. Does our timecache for this region match the src's timecache? 
3. If not, get new data in until they match
   FIXME: This means that we don't compute? 

4. Consider all of the data we have in the interesting region. For
each set of data that can be computed on: 
   a. if it's in the cache, then whatever
   b. if it's not in the cache, then compute it and stick in cache

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
It would be great to be able to ask a region "what is the region over
t1, t2 where we don't match?" and get back the first N buckets where
we don't match
